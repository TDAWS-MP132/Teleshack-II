To start off, this will assume you know how to and have made a map, and
you're just looking to insert it. You'll need to use Tiled, which
you can find here: https://www.mapeditor.org/
My personal recommendation is to use Tiled all the way through to
simplify the process, but making a map in other places like Builder
or FEMapCreator also works.

Assuming your map is already made, the key things to adjust in Tiled
are Custom Properties and Layers. If you haven't already added tile changes,
then you'll do so here by adding Layers. Looking at the bottom right of the
screen, you should see a Layers tab. Click on it, and you'll see Tile Layer 1
at the very bottom. For each tile change, you'll need a separate layer, which
you can add by pressing the leftmost button in the Layers tab (should look
like a piece of paper with a yellow flash) and then press "Tile Layer".

This will create a new layer, which you can add to by clicking the Tilesets tab
and left clicking the tile you want to put down in that area. Make sure that you
are adding it to the correct layer; you should see that your desired layer is
highlighted blue in the Layers menu if you're adding to it. You don't need to
do anything else but put the tiles down; tmx2ea handles everything else for sublayers.
If you want to turn a layer's visibility on and off in the editor, click the eye next to it.

Now, for Custom Properties. You can see them at the left of the screen whenever a layer
is selected, but the only ones that matter are those of Tile Layer 1 (the bottom one and main layer.)
The following custom properties all apply:

MANDATORY
ChapterID - example: Chapter1
Main - Its value is blank. This indicates that this layer is the main one.
MapChangesID - example: Chapter1MapChanges
MapID - example: Chapter1Map 
ObjectType - The object type's ID in the EventPointerTable (where events and map assets go).
             example: ThraciaCastleObjectID
PaletteID - The palette ID in the EventPointerTable. example: ThraciaCastlePaletteID
TileConfig - The mapchip config ID in the EventPointerTable. example: ThraciaCastleMapchipConfigID

You can add these manually if you want with the + button in the bottom left corner, but
you can also just copy paste them from other maps and adjust them accordingly. If you do add
them yourself, make sure they are string values. Only the main layer needs these properties,
so do not add them to other layers unless you want bad things to happen.

The following aren't strictly necessary but may be applicable.

OPTIONAL
Anims1 - The anims1 ID, if applicable. example - ThraciaCastleTileAnimationsID
Anims2 - Very few tilesets have these.

With this, your map should be ready for insertion. You don't need to do anything else,
as running MAKE_HACK_full.cmd in the main folder will automatically insert your map.
