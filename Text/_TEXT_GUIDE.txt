If you're a builder user, text isn't too different here,
though I suggest you refer to this guide on text editing from Darrman,
since we'll probably be referring to it a good bit.
My text editor of choice is Sublime, but Notepad++ also works.

First, some organizational aspects:
- ChapterText is in the ChapterText folder. Make sure to #include your chapter's text file
in ChapterTextInstaller.txt
- Battle, death, and escape quotes are all in this main folder, so make any relevant edits 
for those tables there.
- Character, item, and music (used for soundroom) names are all in the CharClassItemsEtc folder.

The major difference in buildfile text editing is that you don't have to go down a
list of text entries or anything like that. Instead, there will be sections
where you can just increment the text entry instead, like so: 

## ExampleTextDefinitionHere

What this does is pretty simple: It defines the text entry's textID
as the next available one, meaning there's no need to worry about
overwriting text entries. 
Also, keep in mind how long each line is. In general, keeping normal
text entries at 40 characters or less will avoid any spilling over,
but some types of text, like Battle Quotes or CG Text, are shorter,
which should not be much more than 30 characters or so per line.
Let's look at an example text entry:

## ExampleTextDefinitionHere
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
This is an example text entry[NL]
for newbies to refer to.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hello.[A][X]

A few differences from Builder: Every text entry needs
[X] at the end to show that the text entry is done.
Further, whenever you need to go to a new line, write
[NL] or [N] to indicate this. These terms in the brackets
are called parse definitions, and you can see the full
list of them in ParseDefinitions.txt in this folder.

To list a few of the most common ones and their functions:

[N] - New Line
[A] - Pauses Text until A is pressed
[AN] - [A][N] as you'd expect, pauses text and then new lines.
[Yes] - Brings up a Yes/No choice, defaulting on Yes.
If you're using this, you'll probably want to disable text skipping as well.
Yes returns 1 to slot C (we'll get to memory slots in the Events section)
and No returns 0, which you can use for various choices you may want to give to the player.

[ToggleInvert] - Inverts the colors of the textbox, so white font/black box.
[ToggleSmile] - Makes units smile when they talk.
[Red] - Makes text red. Most commonly used for gameplay related dialogue.
[Blink] - Makes the character blink for a short amount of time.
[Beat] - Stops the mouth movement of a character, pauses, and re-toggles it.

[Event] - You'll use this whenever you want to pause a text entry for events; for example, if you want a mid-text music change. This will be expanded upon more in the Events tutorial.
[.4]/[.5]/[.6]/[.7] - These are all pauses, with each one increasing in length.
[FarFarLeft] and others - These refer to the character's position on the screen. You'll want to put this whenever you want to swap which slot's talking or when you're loading in a character.
[MoveFarFarLeft] and others - Moves the unit to the given slot.
[ClearFace] - Removes the unit from the scene.


[LoadActive] - This loads the portrait of the active unit. Frequently used for village visits or other similar events where any character can trigger it.
[LoadLoewe] - An example character load, which stands in for [LoadFace][0x14][0x1]. [LoadFace] is self-explanatory, 0x14 is his placement in the Portrait Table, while [0x1] just says that this is the default face.
[CloseSpeechSlow] - Despite what it says, I've never found [CloseSpeechFast] to be faster than this one, so take the slow part with a grain of salt. This closes a speech bubble. 

With CG text specifically, the [SetName] and [NL] at the start of
each entry must have an even number of characters in it. Example: 

## Ch1SvetomirPesteringLoeweText1
[SetName]??? [NL]
Hey, you awake?[A][X]

This works because it has 4 characters, but if there were 5,
like [SetName] ??? [NL], then it wouldn't recognize this as a
CG text header and it then uses [NL] for the next line, skipping it.

For anything else, referring to Darrman's guide should help.
