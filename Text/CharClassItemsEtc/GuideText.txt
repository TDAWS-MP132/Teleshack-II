## ShoveMechanicSubPageTitle
Shove[X]

## ShoveDescGuide
Units can Shove any adjacent[N]
ally or enemy, regardless of Bld.[N]
However, mounted units cannot[N]
Shove and cannot be Shoved.[X]

## CantoMechanicSubPageTitle
Canto[X]

## CantoDescGuide
After non-Wait actions, mounted[N]
units can use up their remaining[N]
unused movement. No actions[N]
can be performed while Cantoing[N]
except Wait.[X]

## SkillsMechanicSubPageTitle
Skills[X]

## SkillsDescGuide
Skills are abilities granted[N]
to units through a few means;[N]
inherently, by class, and with[N]
items. No unit will gain skills[N]
through leveling up, and very[N]
few of them have more than one.[X]

## FatigueDescGuide
Fatigue simulates unit tiredness.[N]
If a unit's fatigue exceeds their[N]
HP, they will no longer gain EXP[N]
or WEXP on the map, and they[N]
can't be deployed when fatigued.[N]
Benching a unit for 1 chapter will[N]
reset their fatigue to 0, which is[N]
the only way to remove fatigue.[N]
[N]
Fatigue builds for each action[N]
a unit takes. This includes[N]
battling (regardless of phase),[N]
stealing, using a staff, rallying,[N]
or using repositonal skills.[N]
Each unit gains 1 fatigue per[N]
action unless they use staves.[N]
Staffing gives fatigue scaling[N]
with staff rank: E gives 1,[N]
D gives 2, C gives 3, and so on.[N]
[N]
Fatigue begins to increment[N]
starting during chapter 4.[X]

## PCCDescGuide
PCC stands for "Pursuit[N]
Critical Coefficient".[N]
On follow-up attacks,[N]
a unit's Crit is[N]
multiplied by this value.[N]
[N]
For example, if a unit attacks[N]
an enemy twice and has a PCC of[N]
5 and a crit of 1, their first[N]
attack will have 1% crit rate,[N]
while the 2nd attack will be 5%.[N]
[N]
A brave attack is not considered[N]
a follow-up, unless the unit[N]
doubles naturally. In this case,[N]
the second two attacks[N]
are considered follow-ups.[X]

## DismountDescGuide
Units that are mounted, such[N]
as cavalry, pegasi, and wyverns,[N]
must dismount indoors.[N]
[N]
Units will automatically[N]
dismount or mount pending[N]
starting position in each map.[N]
[N]
Your unit cannot move after[N]
dismounting. Mounted units are[N]
unable to traverse indoor tiles.[N]
[N]
Dismount penalties will display[N]
in red on the unit status screen.[N]
Dismounted units lose 3 Mov,[N]
giving them 1 less Mov than[N]
infantry (6/7 promoted).[N]
This puts them at the same level[N]
of Mov as armors and healers.[X]

## CaptureDescGuide
If a unit has greater BLD than[N]
the enemy, they can Capture.[N]
Capturing follows the same rules[N]
as Rescue does, and enemies[N]
will not capture player units.[N]
[N]
Capture halves all attacking[N]
unit's stats. If the capturing[N]
unit is able to bring the enemy[N]
down to 0 HP, the enemy will be[N]
captured, or held, similar to[N]
rescuing an ally.[N]
[N]
Once captured, units may trade[N]
items off enemies. This is your[N]
primary method of gathering new[N]
items, as drop items do not exist.[N]
[N]
Beware, once you release an[N]
enemy, they will disappear[N]
from the map.[X]

## StealDescGuide
Units with the steal command[N]
are able to steal items from[N]
adjcaent enemy inventories[N]
if their SPD is greater than[N]
or equal to the enemy SPD.[N]
[N]
Units can steal any item[N]
in their inventory, including,[N]
but not limited to,[N]
tomes, staves, and weapons,[N]
as long as their BLD > item WT.[N]
[N]
You cannot steal if the stealing[N]
unit's inventory is full.[X]

## RescueDescGuide
Units can rescue any ally or[N]
NPC unit if their BLD is[N]
greater than the adjacent unit.[N]
[N]
Mounted units can rescue any[N]
dismounted unit, as long as[N]
that unit does not have 20 Bld.[N]
[N]
Mounted units cannot be rescued.[N]
You must dismount in order[N]
to be rescued.[X]

## SupportsDescGuide
Units may have support bonuses[N]
with other allied units.[N]
These are hidden bonuses[N]
that do not grow or scale[N]
during the game, and there[N]
is no way to increase their[N]
potency or gain new supports.[N]
[N]
Units with supports must be[N]
within 3 spaces of each other[N]
to activate the bonus.[X]

## InterludesDescGuide
Interlude chapters appear[N]
multiple times during the game.[N]
These chapters allow you to[N]
recruit 2 new units there.[N]
You may select up to 2 of the[N]
units available in each interlude.[N]
If you do not select a unit[N]
during their interlude,[N]
they will not appear again.[N]
[N]
Interlude chapters do not reset[N]
fatigue for existing units.[X]

## WeaponTriangleDescGuide
Weapon triangle bonuses provide[N]
+1 DMG and +10 HIT when at[N]
advantage, and -1 DMG and[N]
-10 HIT when at disadvantage.[N]
[N]
Weapon Triangle:[N]
Sword > Lance > Axe > Sword[N]
[N]
Magic Triangle[N]
Anima > Light > Dark > Anima[X]

## EquipsDescGuide
Some items in this game[N]
must be equipped to observe[N]
their effects.[N]
These items may provide[N]
skills, stats, or other[N]
bonuses, such as growth boosts.[X]

## LeadershipDescGuide
Grants all allies[N]
+3 HIT per star.[N]
These bonuses stack[N]
for each star per unit[N]
in your deployed army.[X]

## MovementStarsDescGuide
Movement stars, or vigor,[N]
provides a 5% chance per star[N]
for a unit to move again[N]
after completing an action.[N]
[N]
Movement stars may only[N]
trigger once per turn.[X]

## FreeActionDescGuide
Talk, Trade, Give, Take, Mount,[N]
and Dismount are free actions.[N]
This means you can continue[N]
your turn after completing them,[N]
but may not move your unit.[X]

Escape[X]

## EscapeDescGuide
On maps with an Escape goal,[N]
Cleo and Loewe must both Escape[N]
on tiles marked by red squares[N]
to end the map. However, they[N]
will leave behind any allies who[N]
do not Escape before them.[N]
[N]
Make sure to Escape with every[N]
unit possible before exiting[N]
with either Cleo, Loewe, or,[N]
in some cases, another unit[N]
who is also required to Escape.[X]

## FormulaChangesMechanicSubPageTitle
Formula Changes[X]

## FormulaChangesDescGuide
Various formulas have changed[N]
from their FE8 incarnations.[N]
The changes are as follows:[N]
[N]
Battle Experience:[N]
[N]
0 Exp for damageless round.[N]
[N]
(10 + 2 x L.Diff) Exp for[N]
a hit, with a cap of 50.[N]
[N]
(30 x IsBoss + 5 x L.Diff) Exp[N]
for a kill, with a cap of 100.[N]
[N]
L.Diff = (Player Lv - Enemy Lv)[N]
IsBoss = 2 if enemy boss, 1 if not[N]
[N]
Promoted units are considered[N]
20 levels higher than displayed.[N]
Certain promoted player units[N]
have lower internal levels,[N]
up to Chapter 13.[N]
Their internal levels will be[N]
10 levels higher than displayed.[N]
[N]
Staff Experience:[N]
[N]
10 + 5 x (Staff Rank)[N]
[N]
Staff Rank: The required weapon[N]
rank to use the current staff.[N]
E = 1, D = 2, C = 3, etc.[N]
[N]
Weapon Experience:[N]
[N]
There is no bonus for killing[N]
an enemy. Each hit gives 1 WEXP,[N]
and the highest rank is A Rank.[N]
[N]
Hit Formula:[N]
True hit is calculated using[N]
1RN instead of 2RN.[N]
Therefore, displayed hit is true[N]
hit. Hitrates have increased[N]
in various ways to compensate.[N]
[N]
Hit:[N]
Skl x 2 + Lck + Weapon Hit[N]
[N]
Avoid:[N]
Spd + Lck + Weapon Hit[N]
+ Terrain Avoid[X]
