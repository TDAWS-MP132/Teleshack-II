To-Do List

1. Augur convo with Cleo/Kwame:
she tells them she wants to stay because loewe's sword
frees her from her visions; Kwame asks about the two fates
thing she mentions in 14, and whether they are certain to happen;
The Augur says that the fates are possibilities, and
possibilities can be changed; however, her blessing
won't allow her to see the future while she's with them,
so she can't tell them whether it's changed or not
Cleo/Kwame accept this and move on

2. Boro/Trajan/Mira talk
Boro, Trajan, and Mira (if alive) hang out at the shore and fish (chapter 6 reference?)
They talk about all that's happened, Boro apologizes
for leaving them in the situation they did and says
he never would have if he knew what would happen to Dragana
Mira initially struggles to forgive him, but Trajan responds
by saying that things have changed so much that he can't even hold a grudge,
as long as Boro is really on their side this time;
Boro swears that he is and vows to protect Cleo and Loewe while he's with them in Chouwouj
