[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Didn't think we'd come back here so soon.[N]
I can't believe we met an immortal without[N]
realizing. Kwame, what's this Barod like?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I regret to say I know little more than you.[N]
I haven't seen him in centuries. In the past,[N]
he was a good man, concerned with the[AN]
future of this world.. But in the past, all[N]
four of us were... Time changes people,[N]
I wonder how much it has changed him...[A]
[Right]
An immortal running an arena... This sounds[N]
like the setup to a stupid joke. But it's[N]
all too real. I hope we don't have to fight[AN]
him, like Mureib.[A]
[FarRight]
[TwoLineBox]
Yeah, we've fought many tough battles but[N]
Barod looks to be on another level.[A]
[FarFarLeft]
[OneLineBox]
Decian Liberators, Barod will see you now.[AN]
[FarRight]
[TwoLineBox]
How oddly professional, he really takes[N]
his arena seriously. Let's go.[A]
[X]

## Ch18StartBarod1
[MidLeft][LoadBarod]
[MidLeft]
[TwoLineBox]
Welcome, Decian Liberators! To what do I[N]
owe the pleasure?[A]
[MidRight][LoadKwame]
[MidRight]
[OneLineBox]
Hello, old friend.[A]
[MidLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
Ah, this is going to be a long meeting,[N]
isn't it? Well, spit it out.[N]
What brings you here, Athanasius?[A]
[X]

## Ch18StartBarod2
[FarLeft][LoadBarod][Left][LoadKwame][Right][LoadLoewePunished][FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
That's... a lot to take in. Now, I have some[N]
questions of my own. How did the Kaiserschwert[N]
fall into the hands of Loewe here?[A]
[Left]
After you lost touch with the Lorekeepers,[N]
I was the only immortal still involved.[N]
For much of that time, the sword remained[AN]
with the Cythean royal family. 20 years ago,[N]
it vanished from the royal vault without a[N]
trace. I do not know how, but it since came[AN]
into the possession of Loewe's mother, Catrin,[N]
who passed it onto him.[A]
[Right]
[OneLineBox]
Lorekeepers?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Kwame never told you? Us four immortals[N]
founded the Lorekeepers with the purpose[N]
of preserving the true history of Orodreth,[AN]
as a contingency in case our immortality came[N]
with or resulted in unforeseen consequences.[A]
[Left]
The Cythean royal family, and several Decian[N]
nobles counted among our members. Emperor[N]
Orfeas was responsible for safeguarding[AN]
the Kaiserschwert. Years before he turned[N]
his back on us, he reported its theft.[A]
[FarLeft]
So Loewe's mother acquired the Kaiserschwert,[N]
and Loewe's this [0x93]Seed." This seems far too[N]
convenient to be coincidence. A shame Catrin[AN]
isn't here so we could ask her ourselves.[A]
[FarRight]
[TwoLineBox]
She's gone to Chouwouj, chasing after Taraji.[N]
We'll head there ourselves next.[A]
[FarLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
It's regrettable I missed the chance to meet[N]
the legendary Grimblade. I have just one[N]
last question: why, exactly, is it important[AN]
for us immortals to die? Would Loewe's death[N]
be insufficient somehow?[A]
[Left]
It would suffice, for some time. However, the[N]
strain on our blessing grows greater with time.[N]
Preserving our bodies is relatively trivial,[AN]
but preserving our souls is far more costly[N]
than it once was. Human souls are not meant[N]
to last this long.[A]
[FarLeft]
Heh, so our souls still age, unlike our[N]
bodies. This would explain quite a bit.[N]
Now, you wanted answers about your sword?[A]
[Right]
Yes. I know it's mean for killing immortals,[N]
but why would you forge a weapon with the[N]
purpose of killing you? And why does it[AN]
suppress my blessing too?[A]
[FarLeft]
Thanks to the great quantity of mana within[N]
us, an immortal, if so inclined, could cause[N]
immesurable harm to the world. After the so[AN]
called [0x93]four heroes" lost their minds,[N]
Creating a countermeasure in case the same[N]
fate were to befall us is only natural, is[AN]
it not? Futhermore, it suppresses blessings[N]
of those within its aura, in case a blessing[N]
were to drive the wielder himself mad.[A]
[Right]
[TwoLineBox]
Being driven mad by one's blessing...[N]
Is this what would happen to me without it?[A]
[FarLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
Who knows? This [0x93]Seed" business is[N]
beyond my area of expertise. Best keep[N]
it close to be safe.[A]
[FarRight]
Barod, will you aid us by participating in[N]
the ritual? For the sake of Orodreth and[N]
all its people, we need your help.[A]
[FarLeft]
I don't mind, I suppose, but first you'll[N]
have to prove your worth. Prove victorious[N]
in the arena gauntlet, with me as your final[AN]
opponent, and you'll have my full cooperation.[A]
[Right]
[TwoLineBox]
Prove our worth? We're trying to save the[N]
world! What purpose could this serve?[A]
[FarLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
I've lived a long time, Loewe. I've witnessed[N]
the rise and fall of empires you've never even[N]
heard of. I've journeyed across the oceans,[AN]
to faraway continents and back, and the one[N]
constant I've found is that the strong[N]
triump over the weak. The world cares not if[AN]
you're righteous or wicked. The world only[N]
cares if you're strong or you're weak![AN]
Did the four heroes triumph over Abalone IX[N]
because their cause was just? No! Their[N]
strength, and their divine weapons carved[AN]
Their path to victory. Just as the heavens[N]
were stronger than them, and punished them[N]
for their arrogance when they sought to[AN]
rival Byelen himself.[A]
[Right]
[TwoLineBox]
But they were fighting out of necessity.[N]
How could fighting for sport compare?[A]
[FarLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
If you're weak, what hope do you have[N]
against Taraji? How could I entrust the[N]
future of the world to you? And above[AN]
all, I've still got a warrior's pride.[N]
If I'm going to die, I'm going to go[N]
out swinging. Hahahahaha![A]
[FarRight]
[TwoLineBox]
You're certainly set in your ways. Alright,[N]
Barod, we accept your challenge![A]
[FarLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
Excellent! Take the evening to prepare,[N]
and we'll face off tomorrow. Bring a team[N]
of six, counting you two, and get ready[AN]
for the fight of your lives![A][X]

## Ch18StartCromarAlive
[MidLeft][LoadCromar]
[OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes]...[OpenEyes][A]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Cromar?[A]
[MidLeft]
Loewe, what are you doing here?[A]]
[MidRight]
[ThreeLineBox]
Just clearing my head. We started out just[N]
wanting to free Decia, and now we're trying[N]
trying to save the world. I never thought[AN]
much about what I'd do once we killed[N]
Cidor, but this was beyond anything I[N]
could imagine. I always figured after[AN]
we avenged Dragana and freed Decia, I'd[N]
be able to live a peaceful life, but things[N]
have only escalated since then.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yet you still carry on. I wouldn't blame[N]
you if you called it quits. You've done[N]
more than anyone could ask of you, right?[A]
[MidRight]
I could say the same to you. It doesn't seem[N]
like you've got much reason to stick around,[N]
unless you also want to play the hero.[A]
[MidLeft]
I used to fight to avenge my sister, but[N]
after killing McCallum, I was left with[N]
nothing but emptiness. I kept fighting[AN]
because I didn't see another path for me[N]
to follow. But now, I just want to be[N]
someone she'd be proud of.[A]
[MidRight]
I can only hope Dragana would be proud[N]
of the man I've become... How  could I[N]
face her if I waver now?[A]
[X]

## Ch18ArenaRules
[MidLeft][LoadBarod][Right][LoadLoewe][FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
Before we begin, there's some rules to[N]
keep in mind. First off, no going out[AN]
of bounds! Touch or cross a red marker,[N]
and you're [ToggleRed]disqualified![ToggleRed] We can't have[AN]
you hiding off the coast or attacking[N]
before your opponents have had a chance[N]
to move off the starting platform.[AN]
Second, you better wrap up the fights[N]
quick, because new challengers will take[N]
the field every [ToggleRed]three minutes![ToggleRed][AN]
You've got three rounds before you face[N]
me, so choose your team wisely.[A]
[X]

## Ch18StartNewUnits
[FarLeft][LoadShaw][Right][LoadSera]
[FarLeft]
[OneLineBox]
Gah... We almost had 'em...[A]
[Right]
If I was just a little faster...[A]
[FarLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
Don't sweat it, this arena draws in[N]
the best of the best. That being said,[N]
I really coulda used that prize money...[A]
[Right]
[TwoLineBox]
How do you always spend it all so fast?[N]
I could live off half the budget you do.[A]
[FarLeft]
Hey, what's all that commotion? Looks[N]
like a bunch of ships just docked.[A]
[Right]
[ThreeLineBox]
Don't change the subject! Wait, those[N]
ships are Cythean military. Are they[N]
seriously attacking the Yuria Islands?[A]
[ClearFace][Left][LoadSera][MidRight][LoadKwame]
Excuse me, you two look like seasoned[N]
warriors. I couldn't help but overhear[N]
you're in need of money. Help us hold[AN]
out against the Cytheans and I'll pay[N]
you for your trouble.[A]
[FarLeft]
[TwoLineBox]
You've got yourself a deal! But be[N]
warned, I don't work for cheap.[A]
[Left]
[OneLineBox]
You're seriously going along with this?[A]
[FarLeft]
[TwoLineBox]
You're not? Weren't you going on about[N]
wanting more combat experience earlier?[A]
[Left]
Fine, may as well. A fight's[N]
a fight after all.[A]
[X]

## Ch18StartShafaqat
[MidRight][LoadShafaqat]
Decians, we've finally found you.[N]
You can't outrun Cythes forever![A]
[MidLeft][LoadSoldier]
[ThreeLineBox]
Commander, it seems their leaders[N]
are currently fighting in the arena.[N]
What should we do?[A]
[MidRight]
We'll take out the rest of them,[N]
then after the arena match, we'll[N]
capture their leaders and drag[AN]
them back to Cythes. Heh, looks[N]
like today's our lucky day![A]
[X]

## Ch18RigganEvent
[MidRight][LoadRiggan]
[ThreeLineBox]
At last, I've finally caught up to you,[N]
Decians! I will not fail again. Today,[N]
I'll put an end to your pathetic lives![A]
[X]

## Ch18EndShafaqatAlive
[MidRight]
Damn, we're out of time. We must[N]
retreat while we still can.[A]
[X]

## Ch18EndBarod
[MidLeft][LoadBarod][Right][LoadLoewePunished][FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
It seems congradulations are in order. Well[N]
done! I haven't fought like that in ages![N]
[FarRight]
[ThreeLineBox]
Even outnumbered, you put up an incredible[N]
fight. I can see why you're revered as the[N]
master of the arena.[A]
[MidLeft]
The Grand Oceanic Arena is a passion project[N]
of mine. I created it to challenge and to[N]
celebrate humanity's strength. Cleo, Loewe,[AN]
you have earned your titles as the arena's[N]
new champions.[A]
[Right]
[TwoLineBox]
Thank you, Barod. I trust you will uphold[N]
your end of the deal now?[A]
[MidLeft]
[ThreeLineBox]
Of course. However, you've still one[N]
immortal unaccounted for. Defeat Taraji,[N]
then send word to me, and I'll meet up[AN]
with you as soon as I'm able. The ritual[N]
is pointless until then, and I still have[N]
business to wrap up here before I die.[A]
[Right]
You seem quite certain that we'll have to[N]
defeat Taraji. Do you think there's no chance[N]
we could persuade her to help of her own will?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Impossible. The Taraji I know would never[N]
willingly go along with the ritual. More[N]
than any of us, she was never satisfied[AN]
with what she had. She will kill and[N]
conquer until there's nothing left.[A]
[Right]
Is there no chance she's changed over[N]
the centuries? It's been some time since[N]
you've met, has it not?[A]
[MidLeft]
[TwoLineBox]
You say she's a warlord of Chouwouj now.[N]
Does that not sound like the same Taraji?[A]
[Right]
[ThreeLineBox]
You make a good point. Still, I won't give[N]
up on persuading her, but if we have no[N]
other choice, then we won't hesitate to[AN]
cut her down.[A]
[MidLeft]
Good. Taraji will be no pushover, but[N]
you two have what it takes. I await[N]
news of your victory.[A]
[X]

## Ch18ArenaCheating

Resorting to cheating... I'm disappointed.[N]
The Decian Liberators are disqualified![A]

## Ch18ArenaIntro0
[MidRight][LoadBarod]
[ThreeLineBox]
The heroes of Decia, who struck[N]
down the traitorous Duke Cidor and[N]
expelled the Cythean occupation.[AN]
Everyone welcome our latest[N]

## Ch18ArenaIntro1

[MidRight][LoadBarod]
[ThreeLineBox]

## Ch18ArenaIntro4
[MidRight][LoadBarod]
[ThreeLineBox]
Incredible! The Decian Liberators[N]
haven't lost a single round yet! But[N]
can they defeat their final opponent?[AN]
In the final match of the day, they[N]
face none other than I, Barod, master[N]
of the arena! Prepare to witness the[AN]
fight of a lifetime! Hahahahaha![A]
