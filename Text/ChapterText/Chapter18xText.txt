## Ch18xTaoFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadTao]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft]
Oh, hey. You two are looking[N]
around for new recruits?[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
We are. Why do you ask?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, if you have space,[N]
I[Beat] I'd like to join.[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]What makes you think we'd want you?[N]
Putting aside that you injured Loewe,[N]
you aren't exactly a seasoned warrior.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah, I know. Still, I think I've got[N]
stuff most don't. Like my magic arrows![AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Oh? Did you make those yourself?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No, my pops did. I made this bow,[N]
though. It's a real beauty, eh?[AN]
[FarRight]
Interesting, but we have many archers.[N]
Do you have anything else to offer?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Er[Beat] Well, I got this amulet recently.[N]
After you all left, I went back to our[N]
town and looked through the wreckage.[AN]
My pops[Beat] this must have been his last[N]
invention. I'm not used to it just yet,[N]
but it lets you warp short distances.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Mm[Beat] That is quite useful, indeed.[N]
Does it have any downsides to consider?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Uh, it has a few, but nothing too bad.[N]
Just makes it a bit hard to move[Beat][N]
So then, does that catch your interest?[AN]
[Right]
I can see its utility, at least[Beat][N]
Why do you want to follow us, Tao?[N]
The journey is sure to be dangerous,[AN]
and you shouldn't have any reason[N]
to come along. You're still young.[N]
Why not just wait safely in Freyse?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Even if the Liberators forgave me,[N]
I can't get over how we all got duped.[N]
I[Beat] I want to make up for what I did.[AN]
Is that a good enough reason for you?[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Well[Beat][A][X]

## Ch18xTaoPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Should I pick Tao?[No][X]

## Ch18xTaoAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadTao][ThreeLineBox]
Heck yeah! Uh, I mean, I'm glad you[N]
made the right choice, Miss Cleo.[N]
I'm ready to roll whenever![A][X]

## Ch18xTaoRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadTao][ThreeLineBox]
Oh[Beat] Well, I can't blame you.[N]
If you change your mind and want[N]
my bow, I'll be standing right here![A][X]

## Ch18xApsisFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadApsis]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]You two are the Liberator commanders,[N]
right? I, Apsis, am just a[N]
humble traveling minstrel myself.[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
A bard this far into our journey?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Even so, there has to be a reason[N]
Trajan chose him, right? That's a[N]
lot of tomes you carry there, Apsis.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I got a few[Beat] spell-twisting talents-[N]
It's a hobby of mine. Look,[N]
I've got nowhere else to be,[AN]
so how about you let me join your group?[AN][X]

## Ch18xApsisPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Should I pick Apsis?[No][X]

## Ch18xApsisAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadApsis]
Your sacrifices will not be in vain,[N]
liberators. [CloseEyes]Let faith guide our steps[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch18ApsisRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadApsis]
Tragic. So much untapped power[N]
and nothing to do with it.[A][X]

## Ch18xOjasviFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadOjasvi]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right]
You don't look like an ordinary soldier.[N]
You're from Mahemen, aren't you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's correct.[N]
I am Ojasvi Srivastana.[AN]
[FarRight]
A noble, eh? So, you were displaced[N]
during Cythes's invasion of Mahemen?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That's right. Our family has proudly[N]
served the archbishops for generations.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ah yes, now I recall. The Srivastana[N]
family is well-known for its mercantile[N]
empire. Particularly in the textiles,[AN]
if I am not mistaken.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That is correct.[N]
Did you know my father?[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] No.[AN]
[Right]
Never mind all that, why are you here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
When Cythes invaded, I was studying at[N]
an academy in the Empire. When I received[N]
word that Cythes invaded Mahemen[Beat][AN]
I fled to Decia. I did not want[N]
to see what would become of me, now[N]
that my homeland was their enemy.[AN]
I learned that my family's knights were[N]
deployed in the initial invasion,[N]
but were likely decimated.[AN]
I've yet to hear from my family,[N]
but I fear for the worst.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
You don't seem too daunted[N]
by these uncertainties.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'd be lying if my heart didn't break[N]
not knowing their fate, but if they[N]
are dead[Beat] No, I shall not entertain it.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Quite an admirable spirit. But will[N]
your fortitude be enough to carry you?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I heard your group ventured to Mahemen[N]
and assisted in repelling the Cytheans.[N]
As thanks, I wish to lend you my blade.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Are you well-learned[N]
in the art of the sword?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] I've taken many lessons in fencing.[AN]
[Right]
But you've never seen true battle?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] No.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I doubt we can afford to take[N]
such a novice with us now.[N]
It may be too great a risk.[AN]
[FarRight]
I like her spirit, Cleo. She may[N]
be green, but nothing is more[N]
resolute than a purpose.[AN]
Perhaps she will surprise us.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Hmm[Beat][A][X]

## Ch18xOjasviPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Should I pick Ojasvi?[No][X]

## Ch18xOjasviAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadOjasvi]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Alright, Ojasvi.[N]
You may join us.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You will not regret this choice.[N]
My blade is yours.[N]
I will prove my worth yet.[A][X]

## Ch18OjasviRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadOjasvi][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Very well.[A][X]

## Ch18xZharaFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadZhara]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right]
You don't look like one of ours[Beat][N]
you are?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hail, Liberators! Indeed, I have only[N]
arrived here in Lazar recently, and thus[N]
haven't had the chance to join your band![AN]
I hear your quest of freedom takes[N]
you to places dire- exactly why[N]
you ought to let I, Zhara, come along![AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Er, right. I see you carry[N]
a sword[Beat] or is that a staff?[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
That armor certainly bear the looks of[N]
the faithful, but there's something[N]
peculiar about it[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
In Byelen's name, I've sworn to smite[N]
the wicked and help the innocent, and[N]
my blade here allows me to do both![AN]
As for this armor, I may not exactly[N]
have been[Beat] officially ordained,[N]
but I can swear my skills are true![AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Thoughts, Kwame?[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I see no issue with taking another healer-[N] 
furthermore, one who can defend herself.[A][X]

## Ch18xZharaPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Should I pick Zhara?[No][X]

## Ch18xZharaAcceptedDialogue
[Right][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadZhara][ToggleSmile]
Wonderful! You shan't[N]
regret this choice.[AN]
With Byelen's favor, we will[N]
prevail against evil![AN]
[Right]
Byelen's favor[Beat]I think we'd be[N]
better off without more of that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I beg your pardon?[N] 
Did you say something?[AN]
[Right]
It was nothing. Welcome to the[N]
Liberators, Zhara. [A]
[X]

## Ch18xZharaRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadZhara][ThreeLineBox]
Bah! If this be your wish,[N]
then I shall carve my own[N]
path to saving this world![AN][X]

## Ch18xDarcyFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadDarcy]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right][OneLineBox]
So, what are you capable of?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Me? Well I been fightin' for[N]
House Freyse an' now the[N]
Liberators as a knight for years![AN]
I'm as reliable as you can get with[N]
my armour n' great ole' battle axe.[N]
Plus, armour don't slow me down too bad.[AN]
[FarRight]
Sorry, you said you're a knight?[N]
Forgive my questioning,[N]
but you sound very[Beat] rural.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Eh? Well, yea, I was raised a farm girl[N]
by my pa, but I always wanted ta be[N]
a knight, accent or no. An' besides,[AN]
voice ain't relevant to how[N]
I throw an axe about![AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Ah, I see. You're right, my apologies.[A]
[Right]
Is there anything else you can do?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, I can tend crops but that ain't[N]
what yer after. But hey, what more[N]
do ya need than a trained knight![AN]
I stayed alive this long[N]
and Trajan can back up my skill![AN]
[FarRight]
Well, that's pretty straightforward.[N]
No party tricks, but a good soldier is[N]
a good soldier. What do you say, Cleo?[A][X]

## Ch18xDarcyPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Should I pick Darcy?[No][X]

## Ch18xDarcyAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadDarcy][ThreeLineBox]
Heck yeah, you won't regret it![N]
I'll have my things ready faster[N]
than you can say fiddlesticks![A][X]

## Ch18xDarcyRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadDarcy][ThreeLineBox]
Ah well[Beat] I spose' I understand[Beat][N]
But, do let me know if[N]
you change your mind? Kay'?[AN][X]

## Ch18xGrotoFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadGroto]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Groto knows what you think.[N]
Cleo lady want to recruit Groto![AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Uh, what?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Groto smart, Groto read thoughts.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Sure, as if you know what[N]
I'm thinking right now.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Cleo thinking Cleo is not Cleo's true[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
That's enough.[A][X]

## Ch18xGrotoPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Should I pick Groto?[No][X]

## Ch18xGrotoAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadGroto]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You made up your mind![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] I mean, sure,[N]
you might be an asset to us.[AN][X]

## Ch18xGrotoRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadGroto]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You don't want Groto? Groto sad.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] You already know[N]
that, then. Nevermind.[A][X]

## Ch18xRecruitedTwoUnits
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidRight]
We have made our choice.[N]
Let us hope they prove useful.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed[Beat] The road ahead is fraught[N]
with peril. We should ready ourselves[N]
before speaking to Sir Trajan.[A][X]

## Ch18xTrajanStopsYou
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan][ThreeLineBox]
No need to rush, you two. There're[N]
still some soldiers you can take.[N]
You'll need them, I'm sure.[A][X]

## Ch18xTrajanConfirmation1
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Guess that's all, then.[N]
You ready to sail for Chouwouj?[A][X]

## Ch18xTrajanConfirmation2
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[ToggleMouthMove](Are we?)[ToggleMouthMove][No][X]

## Ch18xTrajanRejection
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Oh? Take your time, then. You'd best[N]
be good and ready before heading there.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene1SacredArrowRebels
# Houvaina in a council room in Telyada, Kailani shows up
[MidLeft][LoadHouvaina]
[MidRight][LoadKailani]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, Kailani. I am glad to see[N]
you up and about, after[Beat][N]
what transpired before.[AN]
[MidRight]
Time stops for no one, so I cannot[N]
rest. Even if I never fight again,[N]
my duty to the rebellion remains.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It is good that you are spirited,[N]
because I have unfortunate news.[N]
Archbishop Mureib has passed on.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
No[Beat] How could this have happened?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The details are murky, but[Beat][N]
Survivors of his battalion claim[N]
that the Liberators did the deed.[AN]
These same soldiers also say that the[N]
Liberators took back Fort Kasira,[N]
moments before killing the archbishop.[AN]
We didn't learn of the news, not until[N]
after they had already returned to[N]
Telyada and sailed out of reach.[AN]
[MidRight]
What?! I cannot imagine that is true.[N]
They saved the Augur, took back[N]
Fort Kreiss and Kasira with haste,[AN]
and we are to believe they turned[N]
on us? There is more to this story,[N]
Archbishop Houvaina. There must be.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What are you insinuating?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]That Archbishop Mureib may have[N]
instigated this. I know it seems[N]
unthinkable, but consider this.[AN]
The Liberators risked their lives[N]
putting Wustheim within our reach,[N]
and Loewe personally saved my life.[AN]
Those are not the actions of traitors.[AN]
Mureib told us little of his past,[N]
so is it not possible they have a[N]
personal dispute of some sort?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]He did ask to speak to that man,[N]
Kwame, privately. I thought it odd[N]
at the time, but now, all the more.[AN]
[MidRight]
Exactly. We can always investigate[N]
this later, but I don't believe[N]
that the Liberators are a threat,[AN]
not to Mahemen. We have too much[N]
else to worry about, what with[N]
the escape of the Grimblade.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, so you've heard of her return[N]
to Telyada as well. My sworn sword[Beat][N]
Ha! She hid her true aims well from me.[AN]
[MidRight]
You cannot blame yourself, Houvaina.[N]
None of us could. In any case, is it[N]
true that she sails to Chouwouj?[AN]
[MidLeft]
So the rumors say. No one has seen[N]
her for long, but one of our rebels[N]
saw a woman matching her description.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] How odd. What could she possibly[N]
want there? Perhaps there is more[N]
happening than we know, in the shadows.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Maybe so. What I would do for the[N]
Augur's guidance in this moment[Beat][N]
but she, too, has disappeared.[AN]
[MidRight]
It was wise to not tell the people[N]
of this, Houvaina. It would only[N]
cause them worry, I suspect.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, but we cannot hide it forever.[N]
[Beat]Do you think the Liberators[N]
kidnapped her? It seems possible.[AN]
[MidRight]
We have no way of knowing, but[N]
I would not doubt if she followed[N]
them willingly. Byelen's will[Beat][AN]
Even after all these years, it is[N]
incomprehensible to me. I only[N]
pray that her visions bode well.[AN]
[MidLeft]
As do I[Beat] In any case, we can wait[N]
to uncover this after we retake[N]
Wustheim with your help, Kailani.[AN]
Regardless of your new injuries,[N]
your foresight has always guided us,[N]
and we will have need of it again.[AN]
[MidRight]
If you will have me, then I vow to[N]
do all that I can. But once Wustheim[N]
rests in Mahemeni hands once more,[AN]
we must look without, rather than[N]
within. The storms of change blow[N]
wildly, and if we do not follow them,[AN]
their violent gales will scatter us,[N]
like arrows on the wind[Beat][A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat1
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
On the horizon, that must be[Beat][N]
Port Lazar? We near our destination,[N]
then. I should inform the others.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat2
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadElias]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Elias? What are you here for?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Kwame wanted to hold a meeting[N]
to plan out our next move, now[N]
that we have Barod's cooperation.[AN]
He asked that I let you know.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I see[Beat] Let's go, then.[N]
We musn't keep them waiting.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat3
# the two go down into a room on the boat, where Coralia, Kwame, Loewe, and Boro are waiting
[FarLeft][LoadElias]
[Left][LoadCoralia]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[FarRight]
Ah, Cleo. Excellent timing.[N]
How close are we to Freyse?[AN]
[Right]
By my estimate, an hour at most.[N]
We should prepare to depart.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. Though, there is one matter[N]
to discuss first, which is why I[N]
called this meeting. Lady Coralia,[AN]
are you certain you and Sir Elias[N]
must leave our company so soon?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, unfortunately. We have burdened[N]
you long enough, and there are matters[N]
in Cythes that require our attention.[AN]
Byelen's physical form, my grandfather's[N]
true aims, and the shadowy Lorekeepers[Beat][N]
There is too much to ignore in Cythes.[AN]
While you head for Chouwouj, we will[N]
investigate these matters and share[N]
whatever we learn in our undertaking.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Right. Our route will take us northeast[N]
through the Decian Strait and around[N]
the northern edge of Cythean highlands.[AN]
Then, we'll hike through Mount Sarloos[N]
and make our way to the capital.[N]
I'd also like to deal with Kassandra,[AN]
but we have bigger problems than her.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Then we split at Port Lazar. Kwame,[N]
has Trajan responded to our message?[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed he has. Our pegasus rider[N]
just brought his reply back, and it[N]
seems he plans to see us off at port.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadBoro]
[Left][LoadLoewePunished]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Trajan, eh? It's been a long[N]
time since I heard that name.[N]
Glad to hear he's still kicking.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]And you, Boro? You'll still[N]
travel with us to Chouwouj?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If you'll have me. I'm not sure[N]
how much use my spear will be,[N]
but I'll offer it all the same.[AN]
[Left]
Useful enough, given our circumstances.[N]
I still haven't fully forgiven you[N]
for abandoning us back in Decia,[AN]
but we can't afford to bicker over it,[N]
not with the stakes as high as they are.[AN]
[FarRight]
I agree. Not only must we find the[N]
sword and secure Taraji's cooperation,[N]
one way or another, but after that,[AN]
we still have to perform the ritual.[N]
For that, we must find our way into[N]
the Cythean palace in Gechrysos.[AN]
And of course, finding Catrin would[N]
help us, though I imagine we will[N]
find her not far from Taraji.[AN]
[Left][CloseEyes]
Mom[Beat] I don't know why she left,[N]
but we have to find her before[Beat][N]
Before I lose her again.[A]
[Right]
We will Loewe, but first, this ritual[Beat][N]
Kwame, this required location bit is new.[N]
Why didn't you tell us this before?[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Mm[Beat] I apologize. It must[N]
have slipped my mind.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox][OpenEyes]
[Beat]In any case, it seems our choices[N]
are clear. We should gather our[N]
things and get ready to disembark.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'll help you out there, kid.[N]
I'm better suited to heavy[N]
lifting than you, anyhow.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat4
# boro and loewe leave; kwame prepares to leave
[MidRight][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
In that case, I will look over our[N]
stores. We'll need a clear idea of how[N]
much food to purchase for the journey.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat5
[MidLeft][LoadCoralia]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadElias]
Lady Coralia, do you mind[N]
if I speak to Cleo, alone?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, not at all. Please[N]
excuse me, Elias, Cleo.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat6
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadElias]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What is it, Elias?[N]
We don't exactly have[N]
time for a nice chat.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Are you alright with this?[N]
Me leaving so soon, I mean.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That is your choice, not mine.[N]
It doesn't matter what I think,[N]
does it? It has to be done.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Right. Tell me something, Cleo.[N]
You told me that you wouldn't waver,[N]
and I don't doubt your words.[AN]
Still, if the ritual must be done[N]
in Cythes, then there's no getting[N]
around it. Our father awaits us.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What of it?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Will your resolve stand firm,[N]
even if it means you must cut[N]
him down without any remorse?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If it allows us to perform the[N]
rites without any interruptions,[N]
then yes, I will do what I must.[AN]
Why the questions now, Elias?[N]
Have I not already shown my mettle?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You have, but killing one's kin[N]
is much worse than anything you've[N]
done. Are you sure you can handle it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I would rather avoid it, of course.[N]
Even so, Orodreth's fate rests on our[N]
shoulders. My emotions mean little,[AN]
in the face of such a burden. Father[Beat][AN]
would respect that, I think. I have[N]
fought, and fought, and fought,[N]
all so that I could become strong,[AN]
strong enough to protect everyone[N]
I care for. That was Father's advice,[N]
so he cannot blame me if I take it.[AN]
I may not be the Seed, or an immortal,[N]
or a princess, but even I have a role[N]
to play, and I cannot squander it.[AN]
Is that answer enough for you, Elias?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Yeah, it is. Your resolve shines[N]
brighter than Argymos silver, Cleo.[N]
Seems my worries were for nothing.[AN]
Still, you're underselling your worth[N]
if you think that you're a role player.[AN]
You're more important to them than[N]
you know. I'm[Beat] I'm proud of you,[N]
of everything that you've become.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
W-What's with all the praise, Elias?[N]
You're not usually this sentimental.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I just thought I should get it off[N]
my chest while I still have the chance[N]
to say it. No knowing what'll happen.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Don't talk like that. We will meet[N]
again, understand? That's an order![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
If you say so, general, I'll make it[N]
happen. Still, I think that's enough[N]
of the sappy stuff for one day, right?[AN]
Let's get ready to arrive at the port.[N]
I'd bet Loewe still needs help,[N]
what with those spindly arms.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha! Yes, you're probably right.[N]
We should give him a hand,[N]
lest he breaks his own trying.[AN][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene3PortLazar1
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Here we are, Cleo. Lazar once rivalled[N]
Telyada as a trade center, but the[N]
Cythean occupation ruined the city.[AN]
It's good to see the people standing[N]
back on their feet again, isn't it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yes, it is. It makes all[N]
of our struggles, sacrifices,[N]
and failures feel worth it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Now we just have to make sure they can[N]
keep smiling. Hmm[Beat] I'll go look for[N]
Trajan and see what he can give us.[A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe! I was wondering when[N]
you lot would show up.[N]
Did everything go well in Mahemen?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well[Beat] a lot happened there, Trajan.[N]
I'll try to fill you in as best I can.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene3PortLazar3
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
And that's everything that we did.[N]
Might be a bit of a hard sell, huh?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Yeah, just a bit. Boro joined[N]
us again, you both allied with[N]
and then fled from Mahemen rebels,[AN]
after killing their immortal leader,[N]
and finally, you found out that[N]
you had some kind of blessing?[AN]
One with world-changing consequences?[A]
[MidRight]
That about sums it up. Oh, don't[N]
forget that we got the lance, and[N]
the ritual we have to do in Cythes.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Right, the weapons[Beat] compared to the[N]
rest of this, they almost seem normal.[N]
Immortals, rituals, Byelen himself[Beat][AN]
I think it's fair to say we've long[N]
passed the point of being just rebels.[N]
So, your quest leads to Chouwouj next?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah. The last of the mythic weapons,[N]
Taraji, and my mother all lie there.[N]
I see no better course of action.[AN]
After that[Beat] Well, there's nowhere[N]
else to go but Cythes. If you can[N]
give any aid, we'd appreciate it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Heh. Never thought you'd grow up[N]
so fast, kid. Wasn't all that long[N]
ago that you wailed in our spars,[AN]
but here you stand, despite it all.[N]
Of course, I'll give whatever help[N]
I can. You need soldiers, yeah?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Any you can spare.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I have a few gathered, since I thought[N]
this might happen. Also[Beat] Oy, Tao![A][X]

I trust you remember Loewe?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I bet that it'd be difficult[N]
to forget me. Right, Tao?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I[Beat] I'm so sorry for your eye, sir![N]
I had no idea that Radnitz was behind[N]
everything, I swear! That no good-[A]
[MidRight]
Relax. I'm not angry about it, really.[N]
We've all made mistakes[Beat] myself[N]
included, so there's no sense in it.[AN]
Just[Beat] leave all that behind,[N]
and find your own reason to live.[N]
Vengeance won't take you anywhere.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'll[Beat] consider it, commander. I know[N]
General Trajan already mentioned it,[N]
but if you're looking for soldiers,[AN]
I can come with you. I-If you're[N]
willing to accept me, of course![A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I'll leave that decision to Cleo[N]

so they can do the recruiting instead.[AN]

Ah, you must be General Trajan.[N]
Forgive us for imposing on you,[AN]
but do you know of any crew[N]
that could take us through[N]
the Decian Strait to Mount Sarloos?[A]
[FarLeft]
That armor[Beat] you're the former[N]
general of the Decian occupation?[N]
Can't say I want to help you out,[AN]
but Loewe said that I could trust you.[AN]
[Beat]You'll need an experienced sailor[N]
to navigate during that journey,[N]
along with a strong crew of fighters.[AN]
I'll gather what men I can and guide[N]
you there. Sitting around here and[N]
doing nothing rubs me the wrong way,[AN]
given how high the stakes are now.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Aren't you busy watching over Decia?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Maybe at the start, but things have[N]
stabilized recently. We don't have[N]
a lord, or Mahemen's archbishops,[AN]
but the people have started to learn[N]
what it means to rule themselves.[AN]
Representatives from each village[N]
have a say in Decia's operations,[N]
so I'm hardly needed here anymore.[AN]
Besides[Beat] this may be selfish,[N]
but I'm going crazy staying in place.[N]
I've been aching for a good fight![AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Thank you, sir.[N]
You won't regret it.[AN]
[Right]
We'll begin preparations immediately.[N]
First, let's secure a boat, eh?[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene3PortLazar6
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished][ThreeLineBox]
If that's all, then I'll leave now.[N]
[Beat]Stay safe out there, Trajan.[N]
Mount Sarloos isn't a cakewalk,[AN]
from what Elias told me.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ha, you don't need to worry about me![N]
I can handle myself well enough.[AN]

Beats me. He said he needed to think,[N]
so he's leaving the rest to you two.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
How peculiar[Beat] Well, he has much to[N]
consider, so we shouldn't bother him.[AN]
Cleo, do you mind if I accompany you?[N]
I should like to see these fighters[N]
for myself, to measure their utility.[AN]

Fine by me. This will be our last[N]

He must be somewhere around here[Beat][AN]

I'd wager he's just outside of town.[N]
May take some doing to find him,[N]
though[Beat] He knows the woods well.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Perhaps, but we will find[N]
him eventually, I'm sure.[AN]

Good luck in Chouwouj, and stay safe.[AN]

some time, and he still hasn't shown.[N]
Do you think Loewe ran out of town?[A]

I think I see him, over there.[A][X]

Ha, did you now? I didn't mean[N]
to worry you, really. Just[N]
needed a bit of time to think.[AN]
[FarRight]
Ah, don't we all? I certainly[N]
have taken my fair share of[N]
such retreats in my day. Now,[AN]
let us return to Port Lazar.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Not yet, [OpenQuote]Kwame".[N]
Not while I still have questions.[A][X]

## Ch18xEndingScene2InTheClearing3
[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
Y-You'd point that blade at me?[N]
The one made with my own blood?[N]
What's gotten into you, Loewe?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What's gotten into me?! I warned you[N]
before not to hide important details,[N]
and you continued to do just that![AN]
We didn't even know that the ritual[N]
needed to be done in Cythes before[N]
today. I'm tired of this farce![AN]
I won't put up with your cryptic[N]
mutterings anymore. Answer what I ask,[N]
or I'll lock you in with Mureib![A]
[Right]
Loewe, don't do this![N]
I understand your rage,[N]
but there are better ways-[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]No, let him vent. He deserves[N]
that much, after all I've hidden.[AN]
Your frustration must be mighty indeed[N]
if you determined to cast me away[N]
when you struggled so with Mureib.[AN]
Very well, Loewe. Ask away.[A][X]

## Ch18xEndingScene2InTheClearing4
[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Your true name, then. Let's start[N]
there. It's Athanasius, right?[N]
What did you do under that name?[AN]
[FarRight]
Ah, my given name. Yes, I once was a[N]
Cythean, before the heroes' ritual.[AN]
Kwame is my new name, the one I took[N]
in Chouwouj under Lord Dikembe's employ.[AN]
As Athanasius, I founded and led the[N]
Lorekeepers for many millenia until[N]
I was forced out by Emperor Orfeas.[AN]
I truly believed that Byelen would[N]
guide us to a brighter future[Beat][N]
But now, I understand his true nature.[A]
[Right]
Then you were deeply involved[N]
in the emperor's inner circle[Beat][N]
What changed your mind about Byelen?[AN]
[FarRight]
It is more accurate to say that Byelen[N]
changed than I. Regardless, given my[Beat][N]
connections with the Cythean royals,[AN]
I studied a great deal in the capital.[N]
It was there that I read the Forbidden[N]
Passages and the mysteries held within.[AN]
I learned of truths shrouded in mist,[N]
one of which was the name of the ritual[N]
that forced me into this immortal body,[AN]
the Rite of Eternity. In my research[N]
to eventually rid myself of it, I found[N]
one other[Beat][A] the Rite of Ascension,[AN]
the one I have said we must undertake.[A]
[MidLeft]
Ascension? I don't like[N]
the sound of that, Kwame.[N]
What is its true purpose?[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Undoing the blessings of us[N]
immortals and the weapons is[N]
but a cost in the ritual.[AN]
A substitute for what would[N]
normally allow it to function[Beat][AN]
That is, Byelen Himself.[AN]
Instead, both us and the weapons[N]
have sapped enough of his mana[N]
that we may serve as the sacrifice.[AN]
[Right]
And its goal, Kwame?[N]
Please don't keep[N]
us in suspense.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]No Byelen can last forever. Despite[N]
what it may seem like to an outsider,[N]
there have been many Byelens before.[AN]
When one of them begins to decline,[N]
the Rite of Ascension allows another[N]
to replace them[Beat][.4][CloseEyes] the Seed of that era.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then that is your aim? You intend[N]
to make me sacrifice my own humanity[N]
and replace Byelen? Is that it?![AN]
[FarRight][OpenEyes]
Not in the slightest. My goal is to make[N]
the Byelen of today believe you will,[N]
forcing him to try to stop us.[AN]
He has hid for many centuries,[N]
unwilling to pass on his power[N]
to a Seed and restore the balance.[AN]
Instead, he passes the burden to them.[AN]
With each century gone by, the cost[N]
of our immortality grows greater,[N]
as do the Seeds needed to offset it.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Get to the point.[N]
What do we need to do?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
If Hamdi is correct, Byelen now has[N]
a physical body[Beat][.4] one that can be[N]
trapped inside the Kaiserschwert,[AN]
severing his connections to the mortal[N]
plane and removing every blessing[N]
that burdens Orodreth from existence.[AN]
All we must do is draw Byelen out[N]
from hiding by concealing our intent[N]
and have Loewe seal him away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]So that's how it is? I don't[N]
relish the prospect of forcing[N]
another into that torture,[AN]
but Byelen's actions warrant it.[N]
I wish you would have just told me,[N]
though. What was the point to the secret?[AN]
[FarRight]
I hoped to keep it hidden for longer,[N]
if only to prevent any leak to Cythes.[AN]
Clearly, the time has passed for that,[N]
but don't speak of this to anyone else.[AN]
[Right]
Of course, but[Beat][N]
What happens to Cythes,[N]
if we rid it of Byelen?[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Its blessing, too, shall fade.[N]
The people will have to find a new[N]
home, elsewhere in Orodreth.[AN]
[Right]
Easier said than done! Do you think[N]
that Mahemen, Decia, and Chouwouj[N]
will welcome Cythean refugees,[AN]
after all that has transpired?[AN]
Mass chaos and confusion would erupt[N]
across Orodreth, and many Cytheans[N]
would become naught but brigands![AN]
So much death could be prevented by[N]
the Rite of Ascension[Beat] with a new,[N]
just Byelen! Can't you see that?[AN]
[FarRight]
Indeed, the outcome of Byelen's demise[N]
will be grievous. However, Byelen has[N]
long been constrained by the immortals.[AN]
No such restriction will exist for[N]
future Byelens, unshackled and able[N]
to use the full extent of their power.[AN]
Even if Loewe is just, one day, he too[N]
may fall. Absolute power corrupts[N]
all who would dare to grasp at it[Beat][AN]
Even if it saves Cythes, Byelen's[N]
false order may doom us all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Enough! It's my choice, isn't it?[N]
Just[Beat] give me some time, Kwame.[AN]
We can continue to gather the immortals[N]
and weapons no matter the option,[N]
so we'll continue to do just that.[AN]
[FarRight]
Very well, Loewe, but let me offer a[N]
warning. The Augur once told me of[N]
two fates[Beat][A] one which damns Cythes,[AN]
and one which damns all of Orodreth.[AN]
Please, make the right choice.[A][X]

## Ch18xEndingScene2InTheClearing5
[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Surely, you aren't serious, Loewe?[N]
You would consider the path that[N]
leads to thousands of Cythean deaths,[AN]
to say nothing of the conflict that[N]
will inevitably occur afterward?[AN]
Are you truly so worried[N]
that you may lose yourself?[AN]
[MidLeft]
The me of today would say no, but look[N]
at Mureib. He sided with Kwame once,[N]
but his ideals faded away with time.[AN]
I don't know what may happen to me,[N]
but there's enough cause for my fear.[AN]
[MidRight]
I understand that, but[Beat][N]
Even so, think of all the good[N]
you could do with that power.[AN]
If I could take your place,[N]
I would in a heartbeat, Loewe.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
It's easy to say that when you can't.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's[Beat] Maybe, but-[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It's the truth, and you know it.[N]
Even if you would make that choice,[N]
that doesn't mean that I should.[AN]
Just[Beat] give me some space, Cleo.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fine. Whatever you decide,[N]
I won't complain, but as for[N]
the Augur's words Kwame spoke of[Beat][AN]
We don't know which fate is which.[N]
Just keep that in mind, Loewe.[A][X]

## Ch18xEndingScene2InTheClearing6
[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished][ThreeLineBox]
Which is which, hm? It seems so[N]
obvious that killing Byelen would[N]
condemn Cythes, but perhaps[Beat][AN]
No, it's too early to tell for sure.[N]
[Beat]Still, what a ridiculous choice.[AN]
I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry,[N]
but either way, I have to decide.[AN]
Dragana[Beat] What fate would you pick?[A][X]

## Ch18xEndingScene3OrfeasAndLeonidas
[MidLeft][LoadOrfeas]
[MidRight][LoadLeonidas]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Leonidas[Beat] My summons found you[N]
well, then. I am gladdened to see[N]
you, old friend, in these dire times.[AN]
[MidRight]
And I you, my emperor. Please forgive[N]
me for the surge in Mahemen's strength,[N]
and for Lady Coralia's disappearance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The blame lies not with you, Leonidas.[AN]
That knight, Kassandra, may say that[N]
Elias and Coralia fled on their own,[N]
but her words reek of falsehood.[AN]
Were we not in such a poor position,[N]
I would ask that you[Beat] remove her.[AN]
[MidRight]
And I would do it. She slandered[N]
both my son and my daughter[Beat][AN]
I will not soon forgive her,[N]
but we'll need her spear as[N]
we pull back and fortify Gechrysos.[AN]
Has Lord Byelen yet returned[N]
from his travels in Orodreth?[AN]
[MidLeft]
To my lament, He has not. Just[N]
recently, a bird came to the palace[N]
and told me of His new location.[AN]
Chouwouj, as He tells it, in order[N]
to accompany a "lovely lady".[AN]
I could hardly believe my eyes![N]
In our hour of need, he instead[N]
continues to do nothing at all.[A]
[MidRight]
He doesn't seem to care much for[N]
Cythes's needs, or he would have[N]
helped in our search for the Seed.[AN]
Is it wise to continue to rely[N]
on him? Perhaps[Beat] we should[N]
consider a few alternatives.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Not yet, Leonidas. My ancestral line[N]
has long served Byelen, and I will not[N]
break from that without good cause.[AN]
Joining the Lorekeepers cemented us[N]
as His greatest champions. Even so,[N]
your suggestion may have merit yet.[AN]
If He continues down this path,[N]
then I will do whatever I must to[N]
ensure that Orodreth survives evermore.[AN]
No matter what sacrifice I must make[Beat][A][X]
