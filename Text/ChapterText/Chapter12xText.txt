[MidLeft][LoadTrajan][ThreeLineBox]
It seems like you've still got[N]
some choices to make, Loewe.[N]
Talk to me when you're done.[A][X]

## Ch12xTrajanConfirmation1
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Looks like you've selected some[N]
fine people. You ready to head out?[A][X]

Oh? Well, don't take too long.[N]
Wouldn't want to keep Radnitz waiting.[A][X]

That's all sorted, then.[N]
My business here is done.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Hello, Cleo? Anyone home?[N]
I'd rather not pull a one-man watch.[A]
[MidRight]
W-What? Oh, my apologies.[N]
I was lost in thought.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We can't afford to lose focus until[N]
we know this castle inside and out.[N]
If we let our guard down during patrols,[AN]
there's no telling who might ambush us.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, of course[Beat] Say, Loewe. Do you[N]
remember our pact at the island?[N]
With Cidor defeated, Decia is free,[AN]
and the conditions are met. Well,[N]
you can probably already guess much[N]
of my story, given Elias's appearance,[AN]
but I still want to know yours.[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, right[Beat] I'd almost forgotten.[N]
I'll tell you mine first, but I still[N]
want an actual explanation from you.[AN]
[Beat]I was born in Mahemen soon before[N]
the Cythean invasion, so I don't[N]
remember much of my time there.[AN]
When Cythes's march reached Wustheim,[N]
my parents took me and fled to Decia,[N]
leaving the city as it burned to ashes.[AN]
[MidRight]
You lived in the former capital[N]
of Mahemen, then[Beat][N]
What happened to your parents?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Nothing, for a time. Mahemen fought[N]
back hard, but years later, Cythes[N]
gave in and set their sights on Decia.[AN]
The dogs still gave a token effort[N]
in Mahemen, but the majority of their[N]
forces focused on the new campaign.[AN]
My family settled close to Selese[N]
territory, so when Cidor let Cythes[N]
in unhindered, and our town resisted[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You need not say anymore, Loewe.[N]
Thank you for telling me this story,[N]
painful though it may be.[AN]
[MidLeft]
A deal's a deal. Now, it's time[N]
for your side of the bargain.[AN]
How did someone from the Argymos[N]
family end up on this side?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha, an interesting question[Beat][N]
In many respects, it is because[N]
of my family that I am here.[AN]
My father and brother always lectured[N]
me about the importance of doing the[N]
right thing, come what may.[AN]
I enrolled in the Gechrysos Military[N]
Academy with this in mind, wanting[N]
to aid my country and honor my family.[AN]
Each year, Cythes's harvests grow ever[N]
smaller. Though we knew not the reason,[AN]
I and my peers believed that our service[N]
could bring our country back to its[N]
former glory and save it from famine,[AN]
but when we graduated and finally took[N]
to the field, everything changed.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You couldn't handle the[N]
reality of what it'd cost.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
We didn't understand the true nature[N]
of war. Many of my comrades died[N]
quickly, with their hands clean of sin,[AN]
but others turned into people[N]
I could scarcely recognize[Beat][AN]
As for me, I contemplated methods of[N]
escape but continued to follow orders.[N]
I carried with me the Argymos name,[AN]
and shaming it was unthinkable.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Until you met Dragana.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes. I would have died a shell of my[N]
former self had she not granted me[N]
mercy that day. That is why[Beat][AN]
I am relieved that we saw her will[N]
through. It feels as if I have repaid[N]
her faith in me, if only a little.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm sure that she can rest easy too,[N]
knowing Decia is finally free. Still,[N]
that doesn't mean our work is done.[AN]
Cythes still stands, and we know[N]
nothing of that foul spell that[N]
took Dragana's body as a host.[A]
[MidRight]
Right. That Lost Ritual[Beat] It clearly[N]
is tied to the legendary weapons.[N]
If we mean to learn more about them,[AN]
Mahemen should be our next destination.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Agreed. Cythes is no doubt headed there[N]
after we sent them packing, and we can't[N]
let them take Mahemen without a fight.[AN]
Besides, my mother's sword seems linked[N]
to the weapons, and if I'm right, then[N]
we have even more reason to go there.[AN]
The Mahemeni would no doubt know more[N]
about it than most anyone else,[N]
and we need all the info we can get.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then let's chart out a plan. Perhaps[N]
we should recruit a few more- hm?[A][X]


## Ch12xBeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadTao]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Halt! Who- wait, a kid?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
A-ah, sorry for bothering you,[N]
sir and miss. I wasn't eavesdropping[N]
or anything, I swear! Honest![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Ha, I wouldn't care if you were,[N]
unless you're a secret Cythean spy.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
N-No! I'm not, really![A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Yeah, I doubt they'd hire a half-pint.[N]
Then what's a kid like you doing[N]
wandering around the castle?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I'm looking for my cousin.[N]
We were together, but I got lost.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hm? You two refugees or something?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah[Beat] Mom and Dad are gone,[N]
so we're all we have left.[N]
Can you help me, mister?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Sure, I don't mind.[N]
Where'd you see her last?[A]
[MidLeft]
In the garden, towards the[N]
center of the castle.[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, that's the way you came.[N]
Let's look around there, alright?[A][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene3Part2
[MidLeft][LoadTao]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

Huh? What are you-[A][X]

Dang it[Beat] my aim was all off.[A]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
Aaagh! My eye[Beat] You little shi-[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Be quiet, monster! Don't you remember[N]
what you did? You killed my cousin,[N]
Mifan! This is the justice you deserve![AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Mifan? That loud swordswoman?[N]
But she[Beat] they were turncoats[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Lies! Their only crime was not giving[N]
in to a noble rat's demands for food,[N]
and you killed them all for nothing![AN]
None of them had to die[Beat][N]
This is all your fault![AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] No, I never meant to[Beat][A]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
Loewe, get away from him![A][X]


## Ch12xBeginningScene4Part2SvetAlive
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadTao]
Urk! Let me go, lady![N]
I have to avenge Mi![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No chance of that, child. Svetomir,[N]
please heal Loewe immediately![N]
He could bleed out at this rate.[AN][MidRight][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadSvetomir]
At once, captain! I can save him from[N]
death, but his eyesight is irreparable.[N]
That is, er, he may find it difficult to-[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Just do it, Svetomir! We do not[N]
have time to waste on explanations![AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, ma'am! Captain Loewe, you'll[N]
need to rest after this, I'm sure.[N]
Let us return to your quarters.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Fine. I'll leave this to you, Cleo.[AN][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene4Part3BuldakAlive
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
Now, as for the boy[Beat][N]
What to do with him?[A]
[MidRight][LoadBuldak]
Please, don't kill him! Tao's just[N]
a kid, and he's not lying about this.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Who do you take me for? I'll not harm[N]
a child, but I have no qualms with[N]
hurting you if you don't elaborate.[A]
[MidRight]
The truth is[Beat] the truth is that[N]
Radnitz deceived you. Those[N]
villagers we fought in Freyse[Beat][AN]
they weren't on the side of Cythes.[N]
Just for some damned rice, Epony and[N]
Iberis used you to take it from them.[AN]
Tao was staying in a neighboring town,[N]
so he survived[Beat] but he must have[N]
come back and saw the village's remains.[AN]
I saw him earlier and tried to find[N]
him before he did something like this,[N]
but it seems I was too late, captain.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Explain why you chose not to[N]
tell us this detail, quickly.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
We had too many other allies watching[N]
my every move. Iberis and Epony told me[N]
that if I considered revealing it,[AN]
they would have me killed, and I had[N]
no idea what they were planning until[N]
it was too late. And now[Beat] Mi's gone.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then I will give you a choice. Die[N]
here as their collaborator, or work[N]
for us. If you wish to atone for this,[AN]
the choice should be clear, Buldak.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Whatever you need, I'll do it.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Good. For now, we should give Tao over[N]
to Trajan and let him watch the boy.[N]
After that, let us make our own plans.[AN]
I will not let this injustice stand[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene5
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
Sorry I'm late, Trajan.[N]
Didn't mean to keep you waiting.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Don't worry about it, Loewe. More[N]
importantly, how are you holding up?[N]
I haven't seen you since[Beat] you know.[AN]
[MidRight]
Shooting my bow is more awkward than[N]
it used to be, but I'm still breathing.[N]
Can't ask for much more than that, yeah?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I guess so. Tao cooled down once he[N]
found out about the circumstances[Beat][N]
So Lord Joakim's son tricked you two?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That's right. Radnitz and Epony used[N]
us to do their dirty work. All those[N]
whispers about what we were doing[Beat][AN]
I finally get it. Just thinking about[N]
how smug those two must feel for pulling[N]
one over on us makes my blood boil.[AN]
[MidLeft]
For now, try to hide it. We can't[N]
have you flying off the handle[N]
during our meeting with them tonight.[AN]
Decia's seen enough conflict, and[N]
there'll be plenty of time to figure[N]
out what to do about them later.[AN]
[MidRight]
Don't worry about me. I'll keep it[N]
under wraps, for now. That being said,[N]
let's get to our other business.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Mm. You and Cleo are[N]
headed to Mahemen, right?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah. We're not liberating Decia[N]
anymore, but Cythes conquering[N]
Mahemen would be bad news for us all.[AN]
Do you have the recruits assembled?[A]
[MidLeft]
A few are waiting in the other room.[N]
You can take two of them, but the[N]
rest will stay here to help out.[AN]
We got a lot of applicants once Cidor[N]
was defeated, but we'll need 'em all[N]
to recover from the occupation.[AN]
After liberation comes restoration, eh?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
True enough[Beat] Hm,[N]
where are Cleo and Kwame?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
She didn't tell you where she went?[N]
Cleo said that she's handling[N]
some logistics for your trip,[AN]
and Kwame is assisting her there.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I see. Then I guess I'll choose[N]
them myself. Let's hope some[N]
of them are up for the task[Beat][A][X]

Sir Loewe, I heard you may be traveling[N]
through the deserts of Mahemen. You see,[N]
I am in search of a certain plant.[AN]
I was wondering if I may join your ranks,[N]

hope that I don't regret them.
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Don't worry so much. No matter what,[N]
I know you and Cleo can handle it.[AN]
That's why Dragana chose you two[N]
as her successors. Isn't that right?[A]
[MidRight]
I wonder. That kid, Tao[Beat] It's our[N]
fault that he turned out this way.[N]
If he ends up like me[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
No need to worry yourself over that.[N]
While I'm overseeing Selese territory,[N]
I'll keep an eye out for Tao.[AN]
He won't go down the wrong path.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Thanks. Do you plan on giving the[N]
land to House Freyse, eventually?[N]
Dastard or no, Radnitz is still a noble.[AN]
[MidLeft]
After finding out what they've done?[N]
Not a chance. I was their knight once,[N]
but I left Joakim's service for a reason.[AN]
The old ways are done. We can't rely on[N]
nobles to do what's best for the people.[AN]
[MidRight]
You're right. With the Cytheans gone,[N]
we finally have a chance to change Decia.[N]
The people should have a say in who,[AN]
if anyone, rules over them[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
And that's what I'll make sure of.[N]
One more thing. With Dragana avenged,[N]
are you done with your vengeance?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]No. Cidor may be dead, but Cythes[N]
still lives. For my parents, and my[N]
village[Beat] I cannot be satisfied,[AN]
not until Cythes crumbles at our feet.[A]
[MidLeft]
And what then? When their armies[N]
collapse, are you certain that[N]
will be the end of your rage?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Be careful with your vengeance, Loewe.[N]
It may not lead to the outcome you want.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I'll keep that in mind, but for now,[N]
I need to finish preparations for our[N]
journey west. Take care, Trajan.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadEpony]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
It seems the Liberators succeeded[Beat][N]
but what do they plan to do with[N]
Selese? Without an heir in sight,[AN]
might this meeting be their way of[N]
giving it to us? A united Decia[Beat][AN]
Cythes would stand little chance[N]
against all of us, working as one.[A]
[FarRight]
Perhaps, but there's no telling what[N]
the Liberators may do. We should obscure[N]
our hopes, for the time being.[A]

Welcome, Lord Radnitz, Epony.[N]
It is good to see you arrived safely.[A]

Thank you, and congratulations on the[N]
victory, Cleo. It seems the work of[N]
the Liberators is finally done,[AN]
with Cythes pushed out of our borders.[A]
[MidLeft]
Perhaps, in the long term[Beat] We should[N]
continue the rest of this conversation[N]
in the castle, in case of prying ears.[A]
[Right]
Indeed. Lead the way, then.[A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene3
[MidLeft][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]

[MidRight][LoadEpony][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Excuse me, but are you certain this[N]
is the right way? For a forced detour,[N]
there seem to be few others near us.[AN]
And what of your partner? Does our[N]
arrival not warrant his presence?[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, this is the right place. As for[N]
Loewe, he need not concern himself[N]
with this matter. After all[Beat][AN]
I'll soon resolve it. Now, Kwame![AN]

[Right]
A trap? Damn you, Cleo! Do you[N]
mean to take control of all Decia?![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Better in our hands than yours.[N]
After all, you seem quite willing to[N]
sacrifice the people for your own ends.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
How did you find out?[N]
Was it Buldak? Iberis?![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That's none of your concern,[N]
seeing as you'll both die here![A][X]

Wait! Cleo, please. We made a mistake,[N]
a big one, but if you let us leave,[N]
I'll abdicate the throne of Freyse.[AN]
We'll never show our faces here again.[N]
Please[Beat] just spare Epony's life![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It is too late for regret. Even if[N]
you speak true, you stained our hands.[N]
All you would need to do is talk freely,[AN]
and everything we've built would fall[N]
to nothing[Beat] No, your only escape from[N]
here will be inside a bloody casket![AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
She won't listen to reason, Radnitz![N]
You need to run and-[A][X]

You[Beat] I should have had you[N]
killed when I had the chance[Beat][A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

We can't take back our mistakes, but[N]
I'm doing what I should've long ago![A][X]

Epony? No, no, no, this[N]
can't be happening![N]
I can't do this on my own![AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry, Radnitz. Just run[Beat][N]
Leave me here and escape,[N]
for House Freyse's sake.[AN]
I[Beat] was happy to be with you,[N]
till the end[Beat] Live on, please![A][X]

[Beat]Good riddance. Do you have[N]
any parting words, Radnitz?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ha[Beat] Hahahaha! Yes, I do.[N]
I can see the writing on the wall.[N]
I won't be surviving on this day,[AN]
but neither will you, monster![A][X]

Fine, then.[N]
I'll kill you myself![AN][X]

Hell[Beat] my lance was shallow.[N]

I couldn't[Beat] avenge you[Beat][AN][X]

It's over[Beat] Now, the[N]
tough part begins. Kwame![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes, Cleo?
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
We need to control the flow of info[N]
if we want to keep our Freysian allies.[AN]
Gather the Selese prisoners that are[N]
slated for execution and add this to[N]
their charges. That should buy us time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Very well. I find it distasteful,[N]
but their deaths are guaranteed[N]
regardless. And what of Freyse itself?[AN]
[MidRight]
Send messengers there informing them of[N]
their deaths in a few days, along with[N]
a group of soldiers to guard the region.[AN]
Freysian soldiers, if possible.[N]
Their kinsmen should inspire trust.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Should we make plans for[N]
Iberis's execution as well?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No, that's not necessary. Killing her[N]
would only add to any theories of[N]
foul play, so we'd best leave her be.[A]
[MidLeft]
Very well. You should hurry back to the[N]
base, before Loewe grows suspicious.[N]
We are risking much in hiding this,[AN]
and yet, you are certain of this path?[AN]
[MidRight]
More than certain. He's already been[N]
through enough, and I am loathe to stain[N]
his hands any more than they are already.[AN]
[Beat]Regardless, you're right. I'll leave[N]
the cleanup in your capable hands, Kwame.[AN][X]

[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe[Beat] if you knew, you would[N]
undoubtedly condemn my methods.[AN]
Even so, I cannot rest until every[N]
threat to the Liberators is destroyed.[AN]
This is Dragana's[Beat] No, this is my[N]
own justice. To protect that which[N]
gave me reason to live once more,[AN]
no matter the cost[Beat][A][X]
