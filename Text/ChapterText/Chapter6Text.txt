## Ch6ArenaHint
Put [Red]3[Red] units in the green squares[N]
to enter or exit the arena. Once they[N]
leave, the arena will close its doors,[N]
disallowing any future participation.[AN]
Your units will be healed after every[N]
victory in the arena, and on the next[N]
turn, a new round of enemies will arrive.[AN]
If the red line is crossed, Barod will[N]
get very angry, resulting in a [Red]Game Over[Red].[A][X]

## Ch6LongMonologueIntro
Yuria Islands, known as the[N]
crown jewel of the Decian Sea.[N]
The floating city was constructed[N]
thousands of years ago by the hands[N]
of a young couple, Alf and Eitha.[AN]
A booming trade center at its[N]
time, the city amassed incredible[N]
wealth surpassing that of even[N]
the Decian royal family.[AN]
With their newfound wealth, they built[N]
the tower of guidance, as a symbol[N]
of gratitude to the supposed[N]
goddess of merchants and wealth.[AN]
Their faith bore fruit, as a branch of[N]
the tree of life was bestowed upon them.[N]
Alf and Eitha used their gift to create[N]
two enchanted items, a bow and a staff.[AN]
The bow is known today as the renowned[N]
divine weapon Daybreaker. The staff,[N]
the Azurium Scepter, sank with the[N]
tower, its master, and the master's[N]
followers into the depths...[A][X]

Wahaha! Time to tear apart[N]
those Yurian bastards![AN]
With the power of the Azurium[N]

[MidLeft]
Pirates, here?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ugh, not again![N]
I hate pirates.[AN]
[MidLeft]
How are they swimming[N]
so fast?[AN]
[MidRight]
Probably has something to do[N]
the Azurium Scepter.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Azurium, one of the[N]
divine elements?[AN]
The one that turns people[N]
into fish? Ugh.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's more of a divinely[N]
guided aquatic lifestyle.[AN]
If we find some Azurium,[N]
we can use it to turn one of[AN]
our own into an aquatic fighter.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ugh, no thanks.[A][X]

Who are you supposed to be?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm Leina, formerly a maiden of[N]
Chouwouj, now traveling the world.[AN]
[FarRight]
Forgive our caution, but what[N]
business do you have with us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sympathetic to your cause.[N]
Chouwouj has suffered at the[AN]
hands of Cytheans for years.[AN]
[Right]
Right[Beat] And?[AN]
Why would a noble lady like you[N]
associate with rebels like us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you must know, my lover is dueling[N]
to the death with some[Beat] pirate.[AN]
He is blinded by rage,[N]
so I must rescue him.[AN]
With or without your help.[AN]
[FarRight]
We are fighting the pirates,[N]
so we'll take any help we can get.[AN]
[Right]
Sure. Just don't die, alright?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course. By the way, if you find[N]
a fancy bow, it's probably my[AN]
family heirloom. It's not[N]
expensive and definitely not a[AN]
legendary weapon or anything.[AN]
[Right]
Yeah, right.[ToggleMouthMove][N]

Folks from all over Orodreth come to[N]
these islands to try their hand at the arena.[N]
It is a well-loved bloodsport to many.[AN]
This blade, the killing edge,[N]
is a popular choice among sword-wielders[N]
who dare to test their mettle.[AN]
You look pretty tough. I bet you'd[N]
make good use out of it.[N]

I never recommend leaving your home[N]
without some way to heal yourself.[N]
Why? The world is dangerous![AN]
Pirates are everywhere, at least around[N]
here, and that blasted arena attracts[N]
only the most unsavory of sorts![AN]
Why haven't I left yet, you ask?[N]
Frankly, the weather is fantastic.[N]
My joints have never felt better.[AN]

But, as quick as it arrives,[AN]
the moment he sheathes his mighty sword[N]
the fog begins to disappear.[N]
A strange man, shrouded in darkness, he is.[AN]
My nephew, hearing my complaints,[N]
bought me this tome some time ago.[N]
While you'd think it would cut through fog,[AN]
it has no such effect, sadly.[N]
