Alright, so this one is dependent on which table you're trying to edit.
If it is in the following list (Character, Item, Chapter), then you can go
back to the main folder and click on Buildfile Pro. Note: The Chapter editor
has some weirdness where it wipes the Events section - make sure you set
this to the definition for your chapter's events (Chapter7Events, for example) if you
use it. The Character editor mostly works, though it does affect the CharMagicEditor csv oddly,
so make sure you doublecheck that your units have the appropriate base and growth.

A few off-limits tables: Don't edit the class table since that one's set
in stone beyond any numerical changes we may agree on later.
Further, don't give your unit any weapon types or character abilities
that they wouldn't have available in their class. 

Otherwise, you'll have to edit them in their respective CSVs (the NightmareModules folder)
or their EA file (EA_Files folder). This is probably a good time to mention that you're
going to want some kind of syntax highlighting so that .event files are more legible.

For the tables under NightmareModules, many of them are what you've already seen
in Builder; the ChapterData table, CharacterTable, ItemTable, and SpellAssociationList
are all free to edit for your turn. Obviously, make sure not to overwrite any changes
other people have made; for Items, look for DUMMY slots to insert yours.
You can check what's been defined if you're unsure which slots are vanilla and which are unused.

As for not vanilla tables, editing a unit's magic is done in CharacterClasses/MagCharEditor.csv,
which is indexed by character ID. In Items/WeaponLockArray.csv, you can add a pointer to an
array that mandates who can use an item. The steps are:

1) Define a weapon lock in TableDefinitions.event in the format 0xXX000000
2) Make the definition one of your item's weapon abilities
3) In the XX position in WeaponLockArray.csv, put the pointer to your array
4) Go to EngineHacks/ExternalHacks/WeaponLockArray/AdvWeaponLocks.event and add your array,
following what every other item has done (using a character or class lock)

Under Misc, you'll only need to edit EscapeQuoteEditor.csv, which just amounts to
adding a text definition in the slot corresponding with the character ID you want.
Under Skills, you can add any personal skills to the PersonalSkillTable. If your unit
is supposed to start with multiple, then add a pointer to CharacterLevelUpSkillEditor.csv
instead, and add it under EngineHacks/SkillSystem/skill_lists.event.
The ItemEffectRevamp tables likely don't need to be edited by most contributors,
but if you do need to, ask me about it.

EA_Files has a few more tables to edit, but they're in .event files instead of csvs.
Currently, this is the location of stat boosts for items (in WeaponStatBoosts.event),
the Battle and Death Quote Tables, and the Boss Music table.

If you're making a death quote for a player unit, note that none of them have textIDs
in the entries here except gameover units. This is because in order to use an event
in a death quote, the textID needs to be set to 0, and we're using death quote events
here to send items to convoy on death. You can go over to Events/GiveAllEvents.event
and put the GiveAll event and death text for your unit there, following the structure of other events.

Also, the Sound Room Table is located in SoundRoomInstaller.event.
